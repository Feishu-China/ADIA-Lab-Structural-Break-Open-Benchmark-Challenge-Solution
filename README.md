# ADIA-Lab-Structural-Break-Open-Benchmark-Challenge-Solution
This report studies the Structural Break Open Benchmark by ADIA Lab and CrunchDAO, which aims to determine whether a known boundary point in a univariate time series corresponds to a true structural break. We adopt a deterministic, model-agnostic feature engineering strategy and evaluate standard classifiers using ROC and AUC.
